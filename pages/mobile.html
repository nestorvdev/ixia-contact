<p class="py-3">
    We design and develop mobile solutions for K12 and Higher-Education in the following areas:
</p>
<div class="card-columns">
    
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">
        <img src="../assets/images/learning_apps_min.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Learning Apps" />
        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Learning Apps </h5>
        <p> We develop content-specific learning apps. Educators and learners can download these apps from app stores and use it inside classroom as well as for outside classroom activities. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">
        <img src="../assets/images/mobile_games_min.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Mobile Games" />
        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Mobile Games </h5>
        <p> Our Mobile CoE specializes in creating the most optimum gaming experience on Mobile devices. Taking the ‘Mobile-first’ approach, we develop wireframes and designs that take into account all aspects of Mobility, so that the user experience is not compromised on Mobile devices with different screen resolutions and computing power. Likewise, we ensure that all Mobile games are tested under our Mobile QA guidelines, to ensure they perform consistently and optimally on devices that are most commonly used. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">
        <img src="../assets/images/online_courseware_min.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Online Courseware" />
        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Online Courseware </h5>
        <p> We develop complete online solutions for Mobile that Schools and districts can implement fully or they can take a blended approach in which educators can use a combination of online and face-to-face instruction. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">
        <img src="../assets/images/learning_tools_min.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Learning Tools" />
        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Learning Tools </h5>
        <p> We develop mobile learning Tools and Aids that help teachers, parents and students to access a library of learning resources and functions, while they are on the move. These tools are specifically designed to ensure offline accessibility (in places with no internet connection), with content carefully curated by a team of experts. Periodic updates to content and features are easily downloaded as and when the devices are back online. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">
        <img src="../assets/images/iBook_min.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Digital Books" />
        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Digital Books </h5>
        <p> We develop truly interactive digital textbooks, a new kind of study aid: one that helps students closely interact with content and rich media, take notes and review content as they read. We take this further by designing Mobile templates that offer a rich-engaging, full-screen experience full of interactive diagrams, photos, and videos on Mobile tablets. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="mobilecard" class="card pb-3 m-2">

        <h5 class="card-header border-danger"> Byte-based learning </h5>
        <p> We design and develop quick bytes of learning – Factsheets, Glossary and Quiz items designed to supplement course content. Students get a quick and easy way to assess their knowledge and understanding about the selected course whenever they want, wherever they are. </p>

<div class="subprofile border-danger pt-3 pb-2">TECHNOLOGY &amp; TOOLS</div>

    We work with the latest Mobile tools &amp; frameworks (SDKs) that allow for building truly interactive Mobile learning experience. We also develop proprietary custom-made tools that help convert legacy content/products into HTML5 standards for Mobile-web consumption.

                        We work on the latest Mobile Tools and SDKs, that have a blend of native capabilities as well as HTML5 compatibility. We not only build expertise &amp; competency in leveraging standard SDK features like Interface Builder, Simulators, Code-signing, Ad-hoc distribution, Debugging tools, Performance tools, etc, but we also extend the SDKs capabilities by writing custom code snippets &amp; proprietary APIs, thereby making a solid IDE platform to develop complex functionality more efficiently.

                        Gone are those days when you would develop Mobile Apps for each platform from scratch. Neither the ‘Hybrid’ nor the ‘One-for-All’ solutions have worked well in the past. What we truly need is a true Hybrid framework that takes “best of both worlds” approach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">
                        We take a unique proprietary approach to mobile application development. By mixing the rich &amp; powerful client experience that only comes through Native SDKs with Custom APIs written to bind server side logic and data store and MBaaS services, we use the best of both worlds approach in developing mobile applications. We don’t compromise the user experience (snappy response, no lags, animated widgets) for saving costs with develop once and use for all mindset. We leverage reusable components across platforms by building custom APIs for features that can be reused as is on all mobile platforms.

                        When developing mobile applications, there are a number of key challenges where architecture and design are fundamentally different from that of a typical enterprise application.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">
                        Often these considerations are ignored until the end of the project and optimized only when necessary. This results in sub-standard and unusable product, with bugs that are difficult and expensive to fix later in the cycle. What we need is a discipline that ensures each parameter is analyzed in detail, all risks are identified and mitigation strategies are drawn, right up front in the design process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-3">
                        Our Mobile CoE employs the best skill and competency in each area of the Mobile Application Development process, to ensure all key factors are considered during the architecture design phase. We deeply care about our users and in an effort to serve the best-in-class experience we constantly evaluate our guidelines, principles, methodologies, best practices and architecture decisions, in order to achieve perfection.
