<meta name="description" content="We design personalized and adaptive learning solutions that help colleges to achieve superior learning outcomes. College education in the US is facing pressure from increasing tuition costs and dip in availability of student loans. This means college teachers need to be more effective for colleges to justify their tuition fees. At the same time, there is the ‘open courseware’ wave, where universities are opening up their content (typically lectures from faculty) to prospective students thru a ‘freemium’ model. There is also a move towards increased digitization of content – both textbooks and class notes, and an emphasis on competency based learning. And, of course, data privacy concerns are leading educational institutions to relook at their storage and maintenance of student data. At Ixia, we have rich expertise in designing and deploying Student Information Systems that help manage (amidst other things) privacy concerns. We also have expertise in engaging with SMEs for creation of content that has rich media and interactivity. This means we are ideally positioned to engage with college faculty to create interactive digital class content that enhances learning experience and outcomes. Digital content necessitates ontologies and we have significant expertise in building and maintaining the same. And, last but not the least we have a dedicated team for designing personalized and adaptive learning solutions that should help colleges to achieve superior learning outcomes." />
