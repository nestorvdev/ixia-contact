We work on the localization aspects right at the start of the product development cycle, which provides the following benefits: Reduced product cost and faster time to market By leveraging engineering, graphics, and testing resources across the English-language product and its foreign-language versions. By reducing project management and translation costs by integrating the development lifecycles of the English-language product and localized versions. Enhanced content fidelity: The same team of instructional designers, subject experts, writers, media specialists, and programmers that created the master product in English works with language translators to achieve better localized output." />
